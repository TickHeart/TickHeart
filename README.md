Hi there, I'm tick

I am a 22 year old teenager âœ¨

I would like to recommend my good friends [zx](https://github.com/alexzhang1030) and [yswdqz](https://github.com/yswdqz), both of whom have been very helpful and I am grateful to them.

I would also like to share with you some of my projects.

1. [ztcanvas](https://ztcanvas.netlify.app/): An lightweight but powerful Canvas Engine
  * There is a very interesting event listener
  * I always thought he was simple but could do somehen
2. [ztform](https://ztform-docs.netlify.app/): An efficient form wrapper
  * This has been put into production
  * Although he is only suitable for naive use
3. [miniunocss](https://github.com/developer-plus/mini-unocss): An on-demand, atomic CSS engine, a mini version of unocss.
  * This is handy for learning unocss
  * Although he was stranded
4. [pi](https://github.com/TickHeart/pi): An public shell alias
  * Very easy to use package manager
  * Although not very impressive
